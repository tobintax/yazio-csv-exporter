# Yazio CSV Exporter

This script allows you to export nutrition and product data from your Yazio account using the [Yazio Exporter](https://github.com/funmelon64/Yazio-Exporter) and convert it into detailed and well-structured CSV files.

It automatically calculates total calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates per entry and summarizes your data by meal and day.

❗ Limitations

Please note that meals added via YAZIO's AI-based "Smart Tracking" feature might not be included in the exported data. This may happen due to two reasons:

- The Yazio app does not always store these meals server-side, making them inaccessible via the export tool.
- The Yazio Exporter may not yet support parsing AI-generated meals even if they are technically present in the JSON data.

These are current limitations of either the Yazio infrastructure or the exporter tool – **not of this CSV script.**
